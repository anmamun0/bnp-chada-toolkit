# 🧰 BNP-চাদা Toolkit

## 🤖 What Is This?

The **BNP-চাদা Toolkit** is a joke-based GUI launcher that opens a চাঁদা collection window whenever a developer starts coding.  
It’s designed to be **annoying**, **pointless**, and **absolutely necessary**.

> 🚨 **Whenever a developer creates a new programming file (`.py`, `.java`, `.c`, etc.), the _BNP-চাদা GUI_ will automatically launch, requesting your honorable চাঁদা.**

Your IDE will never be free again.
